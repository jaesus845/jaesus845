 I'm a university student pursuing a Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Computer Systems Engineering at TecnolÃ³gico Superior de Xalapa, Mexico. I'm currently in the final stage of my studies and completed my professional internship at CargoSprint, where I discovered a strong passion for software testing and process automation.

ðŸ’» I enjoy exploring new programming languages, expanding my technical knowledge, and working on projects that challenge me to grow. I'm also an extrovert, which helps me connect easily with others and work efficiently in team environments.

ðŸŽµ In my free time, I enjoy classical music, classic rock, and staying active by going to the gym.

Always curious, always learning ðŸš€
